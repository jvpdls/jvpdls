# Passionate about Development and SEO

I'm a dedicated professional with a strong inclination toward technical aspects of website optimization and development. I have a solid background in SEO.

I've had the opportunity to work on projects of various sizes, both within and outside of Brazil, always aiming to optimize the performance of different web pages.
